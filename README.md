# Multi-label Classification of Movie Genres using Semantic Word Vectors

*Multi-label classification is a process by which the properties of data-points that are not mutually exclusive are predicted. Each sample of data is categorized with a target label. Multi-label text classification can be utilized in a multitude of applications, such as social media targeting, recognizing opinions and sentiments and building recommendation systems. Most applications of multi-label text classification do not consider the effect that word order can have on the performance of their models. Our paper therefore aims to evaluate the performance of multi-label learning by comparing the three following pre-training techniques: bag-of-words, word2vec with consideration of word order, and ELMo which takes word context into account. Specifically, these pre-training techniques will be applied independently as feature extraction techniques, and then subsequently evaluated through a Binary Relevance across models such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM, to solve the multi-label text classification of predicting movie genres based on their plot summaries.*
